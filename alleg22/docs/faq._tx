<ul><h4><li>
   What is Allegro?
</h4>
	 See readme.txt.

<h4><li>
   Where can I get it?
</h4>
      From any SimTel mirror, in the directory gnu/djgpp/v2tk/, or from 
      ftp://x2ftp.oulu.fi/pub/msdos/programming/djgpp2/, or from the Allegro 
      homepage, http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/.

<h4><li>
   How do I use it?
</h4>
      See allegro.txt.

<h4><li>
   I'm confused by the installation instructions in readme.txt. What is this 
   make.exe program I'm supposed to run?
</h4>
      Make is part of the standard djgpp distribution, in v2gnu/mak*b.zip 
      (whatever the latest version number is). You should get this from 
      wherever you got djgpp.

<h4><li>
   When I run make, it says "src/allegro.c:22: stdlib.h: No such file or 
   directory (ENOENT)".
</h4>
      This sounds like a problem with your djgpp installation. Have you got 
      the DJGPP environment variable set properly? If not, go read Eli's 
      excellent djgpp FAQ.

<h4><li>
   When I run make, it says "make.exe: *** No rule to make target 
   `src/internal.h', needed by `obj/djgpp/allegro.o'. Stop.".
</h4>
      Did you use pkunzip to install Allegro? If so, I suspect you forgot 
      the -d switch, which is needed to preserve the directory structure.

<h4><li>
   When I run make, it says "setup/setup.cc:1: iostream.h: No such file or 
   directory (ENOENT)".
</h4>
      You haven't installed the djgpp C++ library, which is needed by the 
      Allegro sound setup program. Download lgp*b.zip (whatever the latest 
      version number is), and install it as you did the rest of djgpp.

<h4><li>
   When I run make, it says:<br>
   src/sb.c: In function `sb_interrupt':<br>
   src/sb.c:371: too few arguments to function `_mix_some_samples'
</h4>
      You've unzipped a recent version of Allegro on top of an older 
      release, and some outdated files have been left behind. Delete the old 
      version, and reinstall into an empty directory.

<h4><li>
   Even though I included allegro.h, when I try to compile a program using 
   Allegro, I get lots of errors like:<br>
   C:\TEMP\ccdaaaaa(.text+0x9):x.c: undefined reference to `allegro_init'<br>
   C:\TEMP\ccdaaaaa(.text+0xe):x.c: undefined reference to `install_keyboard'
</h4>
      You haven't read the docs properly, have you? :-) You need to link 
      your program with the library file, liballeg.a. First, make sure you 
      have installed everything properly (running make should do this for 
      you). Second, if you are compiling from the command prompt or with a 
      makefile, add -lalleg to the end of your gcc command line, or if you 
      are using Rhide, go to the Options/Libraries menu, type 'alleg' into 
      the first empty field, and make sure the box next to it is checked.

<h4><li>
   How can I extend the 256k limit on Mode-X video memory? I have two megs 
   in my card.
</h4>
      You can't. The limit is imposed by the VGA hardware, not by Allegro. 
      To access more than 256k of video memory you need to use an SVGA mode, 
      which means either switching to a higher resolution or getting a copy 
      of UniVBE, which provides several low resolution SVGA modes.

<h4><li>
   Why doesn't Allegro support MOD tracker music?
</h4>
      Because this doesn't integrate very well with the existing MIDI 
      routines, and because MikMod already does a better job of playing MODs 
      than anything I could write. If you want to use MikMod together with 
      Allegro, get MikAlleg.

<h4><li>
   Where can I find example source code for programs written with Allegro?
</h4>
      Check the Allegro home page, http://www.talula.demon.co.uk/allegro/. 
      If you have anything to add to this, please send me the URL!

<h4><li>
   Why is it considered good coding practice to define PI as a constant, 
   rather than just using the value 3.141592 in my code?
</h4>
      It simplifies the maintenance of your program, in case the value of PI 
      ever needs to be changed.

<h4><li>
   I'm still confused. Where can I get help?
</h4>
      Either mail me (shawn@talula.demon.co.uk), or ask on the djgpp 
      newsgroup, comp.os.msdos.djgpp.
