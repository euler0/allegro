/* 
 * Example program for the Allegro library, by Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz.
 *
 * This program demonstrates how to access the contents of an Allegro
 * datafile (created by the grabber utility) linked to the exe by the
 * exedat tool. It is based on the ex12 example.
 *
 * You may ask: how do you compile, append and exec your program?
 *
 * Answer: like this...
 *
 *    1) Compile your program like normal. Use the magic filenames with '#'
 *       to load your data where needed.
 *
 *    2) Now, if you have DJP, it's time for using it. Run "djp foo.exe"
 *
 *    3) Once you compressed your program, run "exedat foo.exe data.dat"
 *
 *    4) Finally run your program.
