============ Changes from 3.0 to 3.1 (Jan 1999) ============
============================================================

   Changes between the 3.1 beta and final releases: assorted bugfixes, 
   Antoine Mathys added a Swiss keyboard mapping, Thomas Wolf added a German 
   translation of the system messages.

   Changes between the 3.1 alpha and beta releases: assorted bugfixes, FLIC 
   routines can now read from datafiles, included rotation optimisations by 
   Ivan Baldo.

   Peter Cech added support for hot-swapping between a custom keyboard 
   layout and the standard US mapping.

   Neil Townsend improved the accuracy of the timer routines.

   Added an ex40 example program, showing one way to do colored lighting 
   effects in a hicolor mode (and also because it makes the total number of 
   examples a nice round number :-)

   Added an afinfo test program, which does the same thing as vesainfo but 
   for VBE/AF drivers.

   Michael Bukin made a lot more portability patches and some bug fixes, 
   including some improvements to the FLIC player and a much more rational 
   filename handling system.

   Removed the chipset-specific SVGA hardware drivers from the main library 
   distribution. Instead, these will now be available both as an optional 
   addon package, and reformatted as part of the FreeBE/AF project.

   Added FreeBE/AF extensions support to the Allegro VBE/AF driver (farptr 
   access to video memory, and the libc and pmode exports needed for future 
   compatibility with the SciTech Nucleus drivers).

   Fixed a bug with the patterned and translucent vline() function in 15 bit 
   color depths.

   Fixed a NULL pointer dereference bug in the config routines.

   Fixed an order of processing bug that was causing data to be lost when 
   calling set_config_file() with the same filename as the current config.

   Stepan Roh added a Czech translation of the system messages.

   Ole Laursen added a Danish translation of the system messages.

   Grzegorz Ludorowski made a new demo game intro animation.

   Calin Andrian added 3d polygon timing routines to test.exe.

   Peter Cech added grabber support for the 8x8 BIOS font format.

   Stepan Roh added a Czech keyboard mapping.

   Renamed the Spanish language translation file from SP to ES.

   Calin Andrian added a complete set of truecolor polygon rendering 
   routines, with support for MMX and 3DNow! optimisations and a new masked 
   lit drawing mode, along with a new polygon clipping function. One minor 
   change is that POLYTYPE_FLAT mode is now implemented by calling hline(), 
   so it will respond to the current drawing_mode() settings.

   Changed the graphics/sound/joystick driver ID numbers from a zero based 
   list to a descriptive 4-character string, to make them more readable and 
   flexible. Added config functions to read/write data in this format. The 
   sound config data is backwardly compatible, but you will need to manually 
   update any graphics or joystick driver numbers that are stored in your 
   config files.

   Michael Bukin contributed a _lot_ of patches to improve the portability 
   and robustness of pretty much the entire library. The only externally 
   visible change is that the macros used for declaring hardware driver 
   lists have been redesigned to use a more portable syntax, although the 
   old syntax is still available as a compatibility macro.

   Burton Radons did some more optimisation of the truecolor pixel blending 
   functions.

   Martijn Versteegh added a hook mechanism for extending the config file 
   system, which can be used to provide extended system status information 
   or customisation routines for addon packages.

   Redesigned the grabber and dat utilities to support source-code "plugin" 
   modules, which can be used to extend the system with additional object 
   types, import/export routines, and menu commands.

   Ivan Baldo added a dithering option to the 15/16 bit color conversion 
   routines.

   Kerry High added a SNES joypad driver.

   Added a font override to the d_text_proc() and d_ctext_proc() GUI 
   objects, using the dp2 field to specify a custom font.

   Michael Tanczos fixed some bugs in the FLIC player.

   Cloud Wu optimised the truecolor pixel blending functions.

   Disk91 added a French translation of the system error messages.

   Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz added a Spanish translation of the system error 
   messages, and added a new (but undocumented :-) command line option to 
   the demo game.

   Fixed clicks in the interpolated sample mixing.

   Fixed a bug with position_mouse() not updating the mouse_pos variable.

   Fixed a bug in mode-X horizontal scrolling while the timer retrace 
   simulator is active.

   Added a language.dat file, which can be used to provide translated 
   versions of system strings (eg. error messages), in a similar way to the 
   existing keyboard.dat. If you want to use this mechanism from your own 
   code, replace all your constant strings with calls to 
   get_config_text("string"). This allows them to be translated by including 
   a line of the form "string=foreignstring" in the relevant section of 
   language.dat.

   Added an ASCII name field to the keyboard mapping files, in order to make 
   the setup program a bit more friendly.

   Increased the maximum number of sound channels from 32 to 64.

   Modified the DIGMID patch loader to support 16 bit samples, rather than 
   just reducing everything to 8 bit.

   Added an interpolation option to the sample mixer (quality=2).

   Salvador Eduardo Tropea added support for proper 16 bit sample mixing 
   (quality=1).

   Lee Killough added a lower level hook routine to the keyboard handler.

   Removed floating point code from the DIGMID driver, to avoid potential 
   FPU stack overflows.

   Jim Flynn removed floating point calculations from the AWE32 MIDI driver 
   (these could sometimes cause stack overflows).

   Salvador Eduardo Tropea improved the datafile system to avoid linking of 
   unused code.

   Romano Signorelli contributed a Bresenham arc plotting function.

   Thomas Wolf corrected some errors in the German keyboard mapping file.

   Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz improved the ex39 example program.

   Sven Sandberg optimised the fixed point trig routines.

   Fixed some silly crash bugs in the joystick code.

   Added a "compress" target to the makefile, based on a suggestion 
   by Grzegorz Adam Hankiewicz.

   Added dummy bitmap acquire/release functions to allegro.h, for 
   compatibility with the Windows version.

   Added a cross-reference facility to the Info format documentation.

   Martin Fuller fixed an obscure bug in the reading of compressed .bmp 
   files.

   The emergency exit signal handler now correctly restores the previous 
   handler, rather than resetting to the default action.

   Sven Sandberg optimised the create_light_table() function.

   George Foot fixed a bug when the get_mouse_mickeys() routine was called 
   with both parameters pointing to the same value.

   Changed the licensing terms from "swapware" to "giftware". See the 
   Allegro website for an explanation of the reasons for this change.

   Added yet more overloaded operators (this time for long and double types) 
   to the fix class.

   Marius Fodor added support for the Sidewinder and Gravis GamePad Pro. 
   Many apologies for my taking so long to merge in this code!

   Stefan Schimanski optimised the reverse blitting routine (for overlapping 
   images).

   Added a shift+tab reverse focus movement key to the GUI routines.

   Grzegorz Hankiewicz added a new example showing how to create and use a 
   custom color mapping table.

   Totally revamped the joystick system (better API and new driver 
   structure).

   Modified the fix class to work properly with gcc 2.8.0.

   Added a help.txt "how to get tech support" file.

   The midi_pos variable is now negated, rather than cleared to -1, at the 
   end of a MIDI file. This can be used for measuring the length of a file.

   Added a rendering hook to the font structure, for use by text addon 
   packages.

   Improved the VBE/AF text output routine.

   Corrected an error in the way the VBE/AF driver interprets hardware 
   cursor colors.

   Pedro Cardoso contributed a tweaked 80x80 VGA mode.

   The VBE/AF driver now supports dumb framebuffer drivers as well as 
   accelerated ones.

   Added more accelerator support to the VBE/AF driver (hardware cursors, 
   lines, vertical lines, triangles, fixed width text output, and 
   opaque/masked blitting from system memory to the screen).

   Added a scare_mouse() function, based on ideas by Martijn Versteegh.

   The grabber now stores the "grab from grid" dialog state in allegro.cfg.

   Erik Sandberg optimised the 8 bit draw_sprite() and draw_trans_sprite() 
   functions.

   Michal Mertl fixed a memory leak in the generate_optimized_palette() 
   function.

   Added an ALLEGRO_DATE version define to allegro.h.

   Michael Bukin optimised the line drawing routine and fixed problem with 
   the inline asm constraints for fadd()/fsub().

   Fixed potential problems caused by a lag between the mouse state 
   variables changing and the pointer being redrawn.

   Michal Mertl optimised the clipping code for lines, rectangles, and 
   circles.

   Maiolino Carmelo contributed an Italian keyboard mapping.

   Fixed lockup problems caused by the keyboard LED functions on some 
   platforms/hardware.

   Added new create_video_bitmap() and show_video_bitmap() functions.

   Added a profile option to the test program.

   The keyboard handler now correctly updates the BIOS state for the right 
   control and alt keys when it shuts down.

   Fixed a problem that was preventing the DIGMID driver from reading patch 
   sets stored in executable appended datafiles.

   Changed the default sample priority from 255 to 128.

   Fixed some problems with virtual screen sizes in the VBE/AF driver.

   Added two new example programs.

   The VBE/AF driver now has full support for hardware accelerated drawing.

   Added VBE 3.0 support, including new triple buffering routines.

   Wrote a routine to select the sound input source (microphone, line input 
   or CD audio).

   Added proper support for stereo samples. This requires an extra parameter 
   to the play_audio_stream() function, so you will need to change any 
   programs that use this. I'm very sorry for breaking your old code!

   Fixed bugs with the SB16 autodetection and 16 bit sample recording.

   Added input support to the raw SB MIDI interface driver.

   Wrote a new test program to demonstrate the audio input features.

   Ove Kaaven added support for MIDI and audio (sampled sound) input.

   The pack_fopen() function now understands nested datafiles as directory 
   structures, using filenames like "graphics.dat#level1/sprites/zdurgle".

   Charles Mac Donald showed me how to set a 160x120 VGA mode, and more 
   reliable 400x* mode-X resolutions.

   Guilherme Silveira and Theuzifan Sumachingun both independently modified 
   the file selector to only list valid drive letters.
