============ Changes from 3.1 to 3.11 (Feb 1999) ============
=============================================================

   Cleaned up a few places where memory wasn't getting freed during the 
   system shutdown. A cosmetic detail since the OS will free it for us, but 
   it is nice to get these things right.

   Alessandro Monopoli added an Italian translation of the system messages.

   Henrik Stokseth added code to distinguish between win95 and win98.

   Creative Labs have been removed from the THANKS file, because of their 
   refusal to release any specs on the SB Live soundcard.

   Changed the name of the library. After years of thinking that Allegro was 
   a word with no particular meaning, I realised that it is in fact a 
   recursive acronym for "Allegro Low Level Game Routines".

   Established a new mailing list (conductors@canvaslink.com) for use by the 
   people currently working on Allegro. Please send code contributions to 
   this list rather than directly to me (Shawn Hargreaves), because this 
   will allow Allegro development to continue even if I'm not around or am 
   busy with something else at the moment.

   Andreas Kluge wrote a driver for Ensoniq Soundscape cards.

   More localisation: Swedish message translation by Sven Sandberg, Anton 
   Ragnarsson, and Erik Sandberg, Finnish message translation by Antti 
   Haapala, and Russian message translation and keyboard mapping by Dmitriy 
   Kazimirow.

   The midi_out() function now correctly updates the pan/volume/bend 
   controller status.

   Kester Maddock added a Wingman Warrior joystick driver.

   Fixed some problems with the Sidewinder, Gamepad Pro, and SNES joypad 
   drivers.

   Changed the SB16 driver to use signed 16 bit output mode, rather than the 
   previous unsigned format. Hopefully this will improve compatibility with 
   crappy clone hardware.

   Added a new WARNMODE environment switch to the makefile. Allegro 
   developers should all set this to get strict warnings, but it will be 
   left off by default so that the distributed version will be more 
   forgiving about different compiler/libc versions.

   Fixed problem with reading the top and left positions on digital joystick 
   devices.

   Fixed (I think, still waiting accurate confirmation on this one :-) 
   problem with timers running too fast on some motherboards.

   Fixed stupid bug where get_align_matrix() wasn't bothering to zero the 
   translation vector.

   Fixed stupid bug where rotated sprites were coming out upside down in 
   mode-X and hi/truecolor modes.

   Fixed bug where dat utility was truncating long filenames to 8.3 format.

   Renamed the ChangeLog file to CHANGES, to avoid problems on 8.3 systems.

   Various other minor bugfixes.
